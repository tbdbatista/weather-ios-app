# Weather iOS App
This is a weather app for iOS devices that displays current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
I'm importing this repo for other personal repo. 
### This is one of my oldests apps and I will refactor it as part of my studying schedule.

## Features
Displays current weather temperature for a given location.
Uses the device's location to automatically display the weather for the user's current location.
Allows the user to search for weather data for a specific city or location.

## Requirements
iOS 15.0 or later

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Weather.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
Build and run the app in Xcode using a simulator or your iOS device.

## Configuration
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you will need to obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website. Once you have an API key, replace the API_KEY constant in WeatherManager.swift with your own API key.
